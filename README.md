## File description
The repository contains the following files:
 1. `main.ipynb`:

        > It contains the python notebook with the runned cells and the relative outputs for each request.
        We assumed that the requiered dataset and the notebook are in the same directory
   
 2. `no_nx_functions.py`:

        > It contains the python file with the functions used for our implementation of the graph.

 3. `nx_functions.py`:

        > It contains the python file with  the function used with the implementation of the graph with networkx.
             
 4. `[click here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SimoneFiorellino/ADM-HW5/blob/main/main.ipynb) to visualize the notebook with nbviewer`
